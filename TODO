1. move source and header files into 'src' directory

2. clean up listing interfaces API (turn it into an iterator) and factor out
   into its own library.

3. clean up packet_socket interface, document it and factor out into its own
   library.

4. for netmap, make a singleton to hold the device context, each socket
	instance represents a one or two hardware rings. On construction, the user
	decides whether the socket reads or writes, or both. The socket has a
	static member function that tells the user how many read and write rings
	there are.
